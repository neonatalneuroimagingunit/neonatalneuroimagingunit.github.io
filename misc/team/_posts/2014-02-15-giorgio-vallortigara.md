Giorgio Vallortigara, PhD is Full Professor of Neuroscience at [CIMeC - Center for Mind/Brain Sciences](http://www.cimec.unitn.it), [University of Trento](http://www.unitn.it) and Adjunct Professor at the school of Biological, Biomedical and Molecular Sciences at the University of New England (Australia). He's been director of CIMeC from 2012 to 2015 and currently serves as Vice Rector for the Research at University of Trento.  
He's been the first to report evidence for functional lateralization in the higher cognitive processing in the avian brain and of brain lateralization in fishes and amphibians. He developed a novel theory of the evolution of brain and behavioral asymmetries based on concepts of evolutionary biology and game theory.
